# Ising-Model

Basic simulation and animation of the Ising Model using Monte Carlo method. Implemented with both Metropolis and Wolff algorithms.  

Includes animations of the updates, in addition to calculating and plotting energy, magnetisation, susceptibility, and heat capacity as a function of temperature.
